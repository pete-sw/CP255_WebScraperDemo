CP255_WebScraperDemo
====================

Tutorial for scraping Craigslist data with lat/long and making a map out of it using Leaflet
From Paul Waddell's CP255 Urban Informatics course, Fall 2014


Steps:
1) Run the 1st rent scraper
2) Run the long/lat scraper
3) Run the MergeData.py
4) Convert that CSV to a JSON (just did this in an online interface by uploading the file and having it spit it back out)
5) We then wrote a script (based off of the code for last week's TwitterAPI/Leaflet assignment) that converted the JSON to GeoJSON. Run that script
6) Load that GeoJSON as a JS file with a var name
7) Run basically the same HTML/JS/CSS as what we had last week for the TwitterAPI/Leaflet assignment
8) Working on some tweaks so that we get all the variable names when we click on the item in the map
